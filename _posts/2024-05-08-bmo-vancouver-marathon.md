Itâ€™s been more than a year since my half-marathon. Last year I mostly focused on building muscle, but I still tried to run when I could, getting up to around 20 km a week. Squeezed in two races, a [5k](https://www.strava.com/activities/9849706816) in September and a [10km](https://www.strava.com/activities/10269957354) in November. Did not seriously train for either, and achieved my sub 25 min goal for the 5k but not the sub 50 min goal for the 10k ðŸ˜….

Before I signed up I had a lot of doubts. First of all I was planning to move...but as things changed near the end of 2023 I decided I was not ready to head to New York City. There were too many other stressors, family things + work things, and I felt like I was making excuses for myself and not committing. I decided no matter where I am, I wanted to do my first marathon in Vancouver, where I grew up, where I have my familyâ€™s support, where I am familiar with.

The following is a summary of my experience and training, roughly adapted from my Notion.

* This will become a table of contents.

## lookback

After my half-marathon in 2022, my goals for the next training block were:

1. more hill training!
2. better nutrition/weight management
3. donâ€™t get injuredâ€¦
4. interval and speed training/fartleks

I was definitely more intentional about (1) and (4), however doing more of (4) ended up derailing (3)...more about that later.

Few key differences since last time:

- I have a fitness watch now!
- I tried out a more advanced training plan: pace/distance specific training instead of just distance
- I started using gels/eating during runs
- I started to use the bathroom during long runs ðŸ’€

## gear check

Having cute running gear is half the reason to run and I have entered my "buy-all-the-running-shoes" era, but with some caveats. A vest is like wearing a utility belt and it gives me so much comfort. A fitness watch has also changed the way I train forever and every 1km marker beep gives me a small serotonin boost.

##### Running Shoes

- NB FreshFoam X 1080v12
    - recovery training
    - the caveat - the shoe I was wearing when my injury first started (pain)
    - going down the rabbit hole of [fake rockers](https://www.doctorsofrunning.com/2022/04/new-balance-fresh-foam-x-1080v12-review.html)
- Asics Novablasts 3
    - everyday training
    - wore this for race day! ended up getting a giant blister not sure if that was because of socks though...
    - very comfy for long runs
- Saucony Endorphin Shift 2
    - everyday training near beginning of training block
    - got to pretty high mileage so stopped wearing this as much
- Saucony Endorphin Speed 2
    - originally the race day shoe but ended up being a bit too small
    - after a trial long run with it, decided I didn't want to risk it
- On Cloudmonster
    - a bit uncomfy, a bit small
    - got as a present!
    - more cushy, looks sooo pretty

## training
Before I get into my training block, I feel like I should talk about how all the little joys in 2023 led to me signing up for a marathon. It was the year I started going to [CSRD](https://app.heylo.co/g/d1fdc906-b4d4-4ac4-9788-cd7b5df4b691?fdl=1) and realizing the running community in Seattle is huge and only getting bigger. It was the year I started to run with more and more friends, in mornings and evenings, at Greenlake, Discovery Park, and beyond. It was the year where, before my office closed, I would take advantage of the Elliott Bay trail and revel at the sunsets. Near the end of the year I was invited by my friend Peter to join some [Cowgill](https://cowgilltrailcollective.com/) group activities - waking up absurdly early on brisk fall Wednesday mornings to run workouts around Greenlake - call it "Werkout Wednesdays". It was invigorating to see the sunrise at 6:30am, get a sweet coffee after, and see how insanely slow I was compared to trail runners. It was motivating to be surrounded by such strong and experienced runners; to realize how much I have left to train and learn.

After looking around and being overwhelmed by all the different plans (Jack Daniel's, Pfitz, Hanson's...) I decided to just go with the Coros [20 week intermediate plan](https://training.coros.com/schedule-plan/share?planId=453063389411983360&region=1&share). It could be imported into my watch and seemed straightforward enough. When I started my training in December I remember feeling somewhat unmotivated but simultaneously trying to push myself harder. Fast forward 4 weeks into my training, during a lovely Werkout Wednesday interval training around Greenlake, I started to feel pain in my left upper foot.

#### injuries

In December 2022, I was skiing and fell into a hole - partially tearing my MCL. Good news was no need for surgery because the MCL has more blood flow than the ACL. Bad news was I began my weightlifting training just to hit another setback, such is life. As with some injuries, it never feels the same after, but I'm grateful I can do all the things I did before. Perhaps there is no correlation, but since then I feel like my left side has a tendency to get injured easier, and the foot pain is no different.

The #1 rookie mistake with marathon training is to overload and that is exactly what I did, almost doubling my training distance in a span of a few weeks. I was so excited to use Cowgill activities as a way to improve my speed and endurance, but in the end it was during those high intensity workouts that I cracked. It started with the top of the foot, but every week felt like a different injury. If the top of foot pain went away, the tibialis posterior started hurting, or the big toe. I ended up going to PT but I wasn't sure it would help me enough.

#### recovery

During the lowest points of my training, after my PT sessions ended and I still felt like I was injured, when I was desperate for anything to help me heal faster, I realized I had a sauna and a hot tub at my apartment that I never use. I started to go after almost every run to boost recovery and blood flow. Maybe it's placebo or the fact that I took a week off training, but I did see an improvement. I was not as diligent with my foam rolling and stretching, on the other hand, but I truly think the heat healed me.

#### cross-training

Gym was regretfully de-prioritized during my training block, although I still continued a plan (power hypertrophy upper lower) and tried to go at least once a week. During the time I was injured especially, I would try my hardest to make up for lost time by hitting the gym. I started out the training block with lots of yoga - a few classes at Flow Fitness and mind.body.hum but nothing too consistent. I still played badminton 3-4x a month and went to some badminton lessons on Mondays when I could. Basketball I played sporadically. Lastly, maybe not the best idea, but a few weeks before my marathon I also started a beginner pole dancing 5-week intro class ha ha...


#### summary

![marathon-training-graph](/blog/assets/marathon-training-graph.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Overall I completed 84.45% of the plan. Considering I took a week off and struggled with an injury, wasn't surprising.

#### longest run (29km) recap notes
- How will I run 13km more OMG
- Feet were uncomfy due to shoes (toe box kinda small)
  - Right foot had slight numbing
  - Blister on right big toe
- My stomach was very angry
  - Could not eat my first gel - needed to stop by gas station bathroom
  - Got pepto bismol and gatorade
  - Felt better after that, kept going
  - Ate the rest of the gel I opened and a sis gel at 19km
- The last 8km were so hard OMG
- Right hip pain after
- Why did everything feel like uphill???? Am I delusional
- Did not sleep well the night before

## diet

Sometimes I feel like training for a marathon is so much of placebo. Doing micro-adjustments or small optimizations to try to be better. Protein, carbs, creatine, veggies...I don't think I did a great job tracking, but here are some of the staples.

##### pre-run

- apple sauce
- electrolytes (liquid iv - strawberry best flavor)
- salt tablets

##### during

- gels
    - preferred: maurten, sis
    - too sticky: gu, honeystinger

##### post-run

- coconut water
  - favourite: harmless harvest
  - gross: kirkland organic
- protein
  - fitcrunch bars! (mint choco)

##### supplements

- greens for digestion
- creatine
- honey ginger lemon tea for digestion
- gummy vitamins for health

## sleep

I used to think I need at least 8 hours of sleep to function but more and more I feel like I can't seem to consistently sleep more than 7 hours. Sharing sleep data somehow feels deeply personal.

![sleep](/blog/assets/sleep.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

## audio

I really thought I could be that person that listens to podcasts and audiobooks while going on a long run but I am not ðŸ™ƒ. Creating a [marathon playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2dd7U3z9E0NEJaQEDMv03e?si=706b122a1e9e414e) was fun other than the fact that I had to find 4 hours worth of content. Songs get old so fast while running...

## goals

Maybe it was ambitious but my original goal was to sub 4 ðŸ˜…. 15 days before the race I re-evaluated based on my training runs and decided 5:45min/km is more realistic which lands me around 4:02. Even that was a bit ambitious with the 200m elevation gain and other unknown factors.

A+: Sub 4:00 (5:40 min/km)

B: Sub 4:05 (5:45 min/km)

C: Sub 4:10 (5:55 min/km)

I'm happy to say I hit my B goal!!!

## race

#### preparation

**2 months prior**: take greens, take creatine

**1 month prior**: no alcohol

**2 weeks prior**: no caffeine

**1 week prior**: taper, bank sleep

**2 days prior**: drink water, carb load

Decided not to wear a vest and just stick with my trusty belt for phone + shorts with pockets for gels. My friend reminded me to go slow on kilometer 30 for the Burrard bridge and I took that to heart.

#### race day
The day of the race I woke up at 6:15 am, not the best sleep but not terrible. I was so grateful for the slow quiet morning: having breakfast with my mom, her braiding my hair. Toast with egg potato salad, toast with peanut butter and banana. Honestly my stomach started off feeling weird, but I ate the leftover pepto bismol and hoped for the best. I did not drink caffeine in the morning either, not sure if that was a good idea or not. Driving to the start line was a bit stressful due to all the roads being closed, but we made it in the end. I brought a thin shirt to donate and headed straight for the bathrooms, the line was long and I felt a bit panicked about that too. I finally found Connie after, who I agreed to run with at least in the beginning, and saw Katrina, and old classmate from university.

Connie was such an encouraging and uplifting pacer. We stayed together for the UBC hills, until we caught up with the 4:05 pacers, after which Connie split off. I had a gel after 45 min or so, and another at 1:30 min. At every drink station I would drink a Nuun and a regular water cup, only skipping 2-3 stations total. I was originally worried about drinking too much but I think it ultimately saved me from cramping. The starting hills were ok, got a lot of energy from people cheering me on like my parents, Thanky, Sunny, Yuna, Ashaya, Harjeet, Qifan, and it was when my legs were fresh. I started feeling my right big toe blister forming near the start, perhaps after 10km in. After or around 25km my legs and body started feeling it. The Burrard bridge was hard but I took it relatively easy as I promised. The last 10km was a very tough push - the sea wall was absolute dread. I never realized what "the wall" felt like until then. I had to stop for a brief time, and at every drink station I chugged electrolytes. In retrospect, probably eating 3 gels was too little, and only one was caffeinated. The short downhills in Stanley Park were so painful I lowkey screamed. The biggest oofs were: seeing my watch turn 3:59:59 to 4:00:00 and having to do the last sprint uphill. The biggest motivators were: music - it was a good playlist but perhaps I should have saved the harder drops for the end, seeing people - it gave me so much energy each time I saw my friends or family.

Emotionally, I almost cried twice. At the start line, I think it finally sunk in that the day is here. The 20 weeks of anticipation and training led to this point. It felt overwhelming but in a good way.
