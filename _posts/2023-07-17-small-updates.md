I realize after not posting on this blog for a while it is a bit daunting to return, so here is my compromise. A bullet point list of some life updates:

* pierced my tragus/flat on my right ear (02/24/2023)
  * it has been a rough healing process but I love the look.
* pierced my nose (06/17/2023)
  * I have actually been thinking about this for a while but finally got it done, I was nervous it wouldn't suit me but so far everyone has said otherwise
* going on dates
  * january was a busy month for that, but I got burnt out quick and took a break. honestly no luck, but i'm definitely less stressed about it compared to when I first started, which I'm proud of.
* continuing to run
  * as seasons change into spring/summer I find myself picking up more and more runs with friends, runs alone. I also recently bought a fitness watch which I'm excited to try out and do some Zone 2 training. I did a parkrun for the first time, and tried out CSRD as well.
* continuing to lift
  * still wrapping up the GZCL program, I've become very comfortable with it and have been pushing numbers. Around now my DL is 210lbs, bench 85lbs, squat 165lbs, ohp 65lbs.
* trip to portugal/spain with mom (03/2023)
  * see future post about my reflections on this trip
* small cutting cycle (03/2023-05/2023)
  * after coming back from vacation in march, it jump started my weight loss attempt and I decided to cut for end of May. It was the first time I felt like I was actively making progress and it helped motivate me. I went from around 162lbs before the trip to around 152lbs at my lowest. I sit around 155lbs now. Weight has always been a big struggle for me, but I would say I've definitely improved my relationship to food compared to last year. Another post about this sometime...
* friendships
  * how do i summarize how friendships grow and change and strengthen? I've definitely slowed on making new ones, but have reconnected with old ones and hopefully gotten closer with current ones.
* trips to vegas, nyc, vancouver

There's honestly so much more I missed...

Some things to look forward to:

* going to visit chicago for the first time (08/02/2023-08/07/2023) with friends
* cabin trip to olympic park to look at bioluminescence
